# Mapping-Suicide-Trends-Across-Demographics
💡 Key Highlights of the Project:
 ✅ Cleaned and preprocessed large-scale health data for accuracy 
 ✅ Extracted demographic and temporal patterns in suicide rates 
 ✅ Designed customized line plots, bar charts, histograms, KDE plots, heatmaps, box plots, and doughnut charts 
 ✅ Applied Z-Test to statistically evaluate gender-based differences in suicide rates 
 ✅ Highlighted age groups most at risk through visual and statistical analysis
 📊 Objectives Explored: 
📌 Year-wise suicide rate trends (Area Plot) 
📌 Suicide rate comparison across age groups (Bar + Box + Pie Visuals)
📌 Distribution of death rates with KDE overlays 
📌 Correlation heatmap for age and numeric indicators 
📌 Gender-based statistical comparison using Z-Test 
📌 Identification of peak-risk years and demographics 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used: 🔹 Python | Pandas | Matplotlib | Seaborn | NumPy | SciPy | Statsmodels 
📁 Project Outcomes Include: 
🔸 Fully cleaned dataset 
🔸 Over 7 distinct and meaningful visualizations 
🔸 A detailed statistical test (Z-test) for gender analysis 
🔸 Data-backed recommendations to support mental health awareness campaigns 
🔸 Insights for policy intervention and targeted prevention strategies 
This project enhanced my skills in public health data analysis, hypothesis testing, and storytelling through visualizations, reaffirming how data can contribute to social impact and awareness.
